## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# import necessary packages
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r la_chunk}

# Learning Assessment 

la_df <- 
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(n = 500, mean =1),
    samp_g0 = norm_samp > 0,
    abs_v_samp = abs(norm_samp)
  )

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_v_samp)) +
  geom_histogram()

```
